## ✨ Making Changes

### Creating a Feature Branch
Always create a new branch for your work to keep changes organized:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Start the Development Servers**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start the backend server
   npm start
   
   # Terminal 2: Start the frontend development server
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Test your changes thoroughly

3. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .

   ```

## 🧑‍💻 Code Style Guidelines

To maintain a clean and consistent codebase, please follow these best practices:

- ✅ **Use Meaningful Commit Messages**  
  Clearly describe what your commit does.  
  Example:  
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Fix: Resolve crash on login when credentials are empty"
  ```
- 🧹 **Follow Existing Code Formatting**
  
  Stick to the project's code style conventions. Use linters or formatters where applicable (e.g., Prettier, ESLint).

- 💬 **Comment Complex Logic**

  Add comments to explain why something is done a certain way — especially for non-obvious or tricky implementations.

- 🧪 **Test Before You Commit**

   Make sure your changes don't break existing features. Run tests and check the functionality locally.

> 🔍 **Tip**: If you're unsure about any part of the code style, look at existing files and follow the established patterns.

## 🚀 Submitting Changes

Follow these steps to submit your changes for review:
1. **Push Your Branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your feature branch
   - Fill out the PR template
   - Submit the PR
---

## 🔀 Pull Request Guidelines

To help us review and merge your contribution smoothly, please follow these guidelines:

- 📝 **Provide a Clear Description of Your Changes**  
  Explain what your PR does and why. Keep it concise but informative.

- 🖼️ **Include Screenshots for UI Changes**  
  If your changes affect the UI, attach before/after screenshots or screen recordings.

- 🔗 **Reference Any Related Issues**  
  Link to relevant issues using GitHub keywords.  
  Example:  
  ```markdown
  Fixes #123
  ```
- ✅ **Ensure All Tests Pass**
Run all tests locally before submitting your PR. Don't break the build!

>💡 **Tip**: Keep pull requests focused. It’s better to submit smaller, scoped PRs than large, sweeping ones.
