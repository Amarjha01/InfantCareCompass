## 🏁 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v18.x or higher)
* **MongoDB** instance (local or a cloud URI from MongoDB Atlas)
* **Cloudinary** account for image management.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Amarjha01/InfantCareCompass.git](https://github.com/Amarjha01/InfantCareCompass.git)
    cd InfantCareCompass
    ```

2.  **Install Server Dependencies**
    ```bash
    # From the root directory
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Client Dependencies**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the client directory
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    Go back to the root directory, create a `.env` file, and add the following keys.
    ```bash
    # Navigate back to the root directory if you are in /client
    cd ..
    touch .env
    ```
    Your `.env` file should look like this:
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    ```

5.  **Run the Application**
    You'll need two separate terminal windows for this step.

    * **Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server** (from the root directory)
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```

    * **Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Development Server**
        ```bash
        # Navigate to the client directory
        cd client
        npm run dev
        ```

The application should now be running on your local machine!
